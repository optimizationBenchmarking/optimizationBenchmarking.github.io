Just now, we provide the alpha release of our {{ site.projectNameStyled }} software suite, version `0.8.6`. Compared to the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}page/2016/05/10/release-0.8.5.html">previous release</a>, several issues have been improved and fixed:

- The syntax for grouping of data by experiment parameter or instance feature values has been improved.
- The error messages and logging information for the `R` engine has been improved.
- The dockerized versions are now significantly smaller (about 40 or so MB).
- Some components under the hood have been restructured and improved.

It comes in three flavors:

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/evaluator-gui/releases/download/0.8.6/evaluatorGui.jar">evaluator/GUI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/optimizationbenchmarking/evaluator-gui/">dockerized evaluator/GUI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/evaluator-evaluator/releases/download/0.8.6/evaluator.jar">evaluator/CLI</a></li>
</ol>

The <a href="https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/evaluator-gui/releases/download/0.8.6/evaluatorGui.jar">GUI</a> is a stand-alone server providing a web-based interface for managing your experimental data, creating meta data, and running the evaluator.

The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/optimizationbenchmarking/evaluator-gui/">dockerized</a> version of the GUI comes as a, well, <a href="http://www.docker.com">Docker</a> image. This image has all the software requirements pre-installed, including the [`Java 8 OpenJDK`](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/), [`TeX Live`](http://www.tug.org/texlive/), [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/), the needed `R` packages, and [`ghostscript`](http://ghostscript.com/). Using the evaluator as Docker image requires more disk space, but apart from Docker itself, you don't need to install anything. This seems to be quite a convenient scenario to me, given that you would otherwise need to install `R` and several of its packages, TeX Live, and such and such, to fully enjoy all features of our system.

The <a href="https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/evaluator-evaluator/releases/download/0.8.6/evaluator.jar">CLI</a>, i.e., the command line interface, is a only the pure evaluator component to be executed manually. This may make sense when running it as component of another, non-Java process. If you would want to use the software inside your Java program, you can just the libraries directly. If you want to know how to do that, <a href="mailto:{{ site.contactEmail }}>contact me</a>. 

Enayway, both the GUI and the CLI  come as stand-alone `jar`s and you can run them directly via `java -jar evaluatorGui.jar` (in case of the GUI) and `java -jar evaluator.jar` in case of the evaluator. In the dockerized GUI version, this is already automatically done for you.
