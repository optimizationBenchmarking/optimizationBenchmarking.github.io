On Thursday, 2016-09-08, I presented my {{ site.projectNameStyled }} system at [University of Kassel](http://www.uni-kassel.de), [FB16 - Elektrotechnik/Informatik](http://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs), [Distributed Systems - Verteilte Systeme](http://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/vs), Kassel, Hessen, Germany and on the following Friday, 2016-09-09, at the [Hochschule Zittau/Görlitz](http://www.hszg.de/), [Enterprise Application Development Group](www.enterprise-application-development.org), Görlitz, Sachsen, Germany. I am very thankful to Professors Kurt Geihs and Jörg Lässig for their invitations. Both presentations went rather well and the audiences were surprisingly large, given that it was academic holiday at that time. The discussions after the talks were interesting and supportive.

The slides and demo material used in the presentations can be found [here](https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/documentation-intro-slides/releases/tag/2016-09-09).
