There now is a [status]({{ site.baseurl }}/status.html) page where you can see the build status of our system. For any of our software module projects, we use several different automated build environments which are all triggered by each commit. Using these different environments, we are more likely to find any potential problem or error early on. We build each commit with:

<ul>
<li>[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org),</li>
<li>[Codeship](https://codeship.com),</li>
<li>[CircleCI](https://circleci.com),</li>
<li>[Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com),</li>
<li>[Snap CI](https://snap-ci.com),</li>
<li>[drone.io](https://drone.io),</li>
<li>[AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com),</li>
<li>[Shippable](https://www.shippable.com),</li>
<li>[wercker](https://www.wercker.com), and</li>
</ul>

This way, we can cover a variety of different Linux setups and even Windows (with [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com)). If our software builds and passes tests (well, hopefully) under all these different setups which may differ in their Java version, OS, utility program (LaTeX, R) versions, this should be a good indicator that it is working also for you.
