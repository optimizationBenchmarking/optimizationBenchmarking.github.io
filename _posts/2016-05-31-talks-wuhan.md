This week, we had the great pleasure to present the optimizationBenchmarkig tool suite at two universities in the chinese city [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan) [[武汉](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E5%B8%82)]:

1. 2016-05-30, [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), [School of Management](http://cm.hust.edu.cn/ens/), Department of Business Administration, Center for Modern Information Management
2. 2016-05-31, [Wuhan University](http://en.whu.edu.cn/), [School of Information Management](http://sim.whu.edu.cn/en/), [Department of Electronic Commerce](http://sim.whu.edu.cn/en/2/5/)

It was the first time I presented the <a href="https://circleci.com/api/v1/project/optimizationBenchmarking/documentation-intro-slides/latest/artifacts/0/$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/intro-slides.pdf?branch=master">introduction</a> to our optimizationBenchmarking system. Each talk lasted about 50 minutes, followed by a question and answer session. Both presentations went well and the audiences were very receptive. I think we got some new users.

As a side note: Both Huazhong and Wuhan University are very beautiful places with great hospitality. Huazhong is the greenest university I have seen so far. There are trees everywhere, which leads to a peaceful and calm environment with very clean air &ndash; ideal for research. Wuhan University is also very green. It has maybe one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever seen. I can only recommend visiting both places.
