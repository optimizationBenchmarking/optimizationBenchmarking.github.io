This week, we had the great pleasure to present the optimizationBenchmarkig tool suite at two universities in the chinese city [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan) [武汉](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AD%A6%E6%B1%89%E5%B8%82):

1. 2016-05-30, [School of Management](http://cm.hust.edu.cn/ens/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/)
2. 2016-05-31, [School of Information Management](http://sim.whu.edu.cn/en/), [Wuhan University](http://en.whu.edu.cn/)

Both presentations went well and the audiences were very receptive. I think we got some new users.
