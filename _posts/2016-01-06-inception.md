The web site of the *optimizationBenchmarking.org* group has been created. Here we will publish news about our system, updates, information, and examples. Of course, for the time being, it will be rather silent, since we have not released the software yet and are still working on it. Nevertheless, this page will be the primary information source about our [optimization benchmarking project](https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking).
