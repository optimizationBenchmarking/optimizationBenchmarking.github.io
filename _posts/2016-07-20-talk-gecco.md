This month, I will present our {{ site.projectNameStyled }} system at the *Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference* ([GECCO 2016](http://gecco-2016.sigevo.org/)) taking place in the [Hyatt Regency Denver Tech Center](denvertechcenter.regency.hyatt.com/) in [Denver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver), [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado), USA. The presentation will be on Wednesday, 2016-07-20, from 15:05 to 15:30 in room Wind Star B as the third talk of Session III of the workshop *Bi-Objective Black Box Optimization Benchmarking 2016* ([BO-BBOB 2016](http://numbbo.github.io/workshops/BBOB-2016/index.html)).

Although my talk has nothing to do with bi-objective optimization, it is closely related to the pretty cool [COCO](http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/) system used in the previous BBOB events. The BBOBies are quite nice to give a spot for holding my talk.

I am currently in the process of making some nice slides for this presentation. You can download the most recent version of them [here](https://circleci.com/api/v1/project/optimizationBenchmarking/documentation-technical-intro-slides/latest/artifacts/0/$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/technical-intro-slides.pdf?branch=master).

I will update this post once the presentation is done.
