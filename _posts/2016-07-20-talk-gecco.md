On Wednesday, 2016-07-20, I presented my {{ site.projectNameStyled }} system at the *Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference* ([GECCO 2016](http://gecco-2016.sigevo.org/)) taking place in the [Hyatt Regency Denver Tech Center](http://denvertechcenter.regency.hyatt.com/) in [Denver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver), [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado), USA. The presentation was from 15:05 to 15:30 in room Wind Star B as the third talk of Session III of the workshop *Bi-Objective Black Box Optimization Benchmarking 2016* ([BO-BBOB 2016](http://numbbo.github.io/workshops/BBOB-2016/index.html)).

Although my talk had nothing to do with bi-objective optimization, it is closely related to the pretty cool [COCO](http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/) system used in the previous BBOB events. The BBOBies are quite kind to give a spot for holding my talk.

I made a set of technical introduction slides for this presentation. You can download the most recent version of them [here](https://circleci.com/api/v1/project/optimizationBenchmarking/documentation-technical-intro-slides/latest/artifacts/0/$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/technical-intro-slides.pdf?branch=master) (which may get updated when I hold similar talks in the future) and at [here](https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/documentation-technical-intro-slides/releases/tag/2016-07-20), you can find the slide set I used at GECCO, including all example data sets and the version of the software used.
